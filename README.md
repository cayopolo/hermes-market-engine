# hermes-market-engine
A real-time market data platform for learning FastAPI, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, and high-performance Python.

## Overview
Hermes Market Engine is a learning-driven project with a goal to build a small but "production-inspired" market data platform capa ble of:
- Listening to an exchange’s real-time WebSocket stream
- Maintaining an accurate, queryable orderbook
- Computing core orderbook analytics such as spread, mid-price, imbalance, VWAP and so on
- Exposing the data through a clean FastAPI interface with autogenerated OpenAPI documentation
- Using PostgreSQL as the main storage layer
- Potentially experimenting with JIT-compiled logic (Numba) for high-speed orderbook and analytics calculations

## Project Goals

Gain hands-on experience with:

- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL schema design
- WebSockets & async IO
- Orderbook data structures
- Performance optimisation via JIT compilation
